"I cannot belive I temperarily put my 60% iso keyboard on hold for this stupid idea"

Okay, I made this well, today last night, after 12 am. I made a schematic, researched all the parts I need. And finished a pcb, I'm thinking the total cost of this will be under one hundred dollars UNLESS I shell out on some keycaps (which I'll 
probably have to because I honestly don't want to spend my afternoon using a screwdriver getting filament out of the tiny little plus'es. So this is entry 1. PCB AND SCHEMATIC DONE WITH RESEARCH! 
Oh and by the way, the reason I managed to do all of this, this fast was because I worked my ass off looking for parts for the 60% keyboard I was making, which can be found here : ("https://github.com/OneForFreedom/FreeBoard")

Time spent : 6 Hours (This is relatively normal for me.)


Entry 2: 5/7/25

I can't Continue. This is a small but expensive project, and I just found out that its a 4 pointer, which is an impossible budget to work with, so this is my final goodbye.

I'll still continue to work on other projects.

Cya!
